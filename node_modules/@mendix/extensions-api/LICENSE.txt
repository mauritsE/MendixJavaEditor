These Terms of Use may be amended, modified or replaced by other terms and conditions, e.g. for the purchase of products and services. With log-in, or where a log-in is not required, in accessing or using the Mendix Website these Terms of Use are accepted in their then current version.

3. Password
3.1 Some pages of the Mendix Website may be password protected. In the interest of safety and security of the business transactions, only registered users may access said pages. Mendix reserves the right to deny registration to any user. Mendix particularly reserves the right to determine certain sites, which were previously freely accessible, subject to registration. Mendix is entitled, at any time and without obligation to give reasons, to deny the user the right to access the password-protected area by blocking its User Data (as defined below), in particular if the user:

uses false data for the purpose of registration;
violates these Terms of Use or neglects its duty of care with regard to User Data;
violates any applicable laws in the access to or use of the Mendix Website; or
did not use the Mendix Website for a longer period of time.
3.2 For registration the user shall give accurate information and, where such information changes over time, update such information (to the extent possible: online) without undue delay. The user shall ensure that its e-mail address, as supplied to Mendix, is current at all times and an address at which the user can be contacted.

3.3 Upon registration the user will be provided with an access code, comprising a User ID and a password (“User Data”). On first access the user shall promptly change the password received from Mendix into a password known only to the user. The User Data allows the user to view or change its data or, as applicable, to withdraw its consent to data processing.

3.4 The user shall ensure that User Data is not accessible by third parties and is liable for all transactions and other activities carried out under its User Data. At the end of each online session, the user shall log-off from the password protected websites. If and to the extent the user becomes aware that third parties are misusing its User Data the user shall notify Mendix thereof without undue delay in writing, or, as the case may be, by e-mail.

3.5 After receipt of the notice under paragraph Access by the user will only be possible again upon the user’s application to Mendix or upon new registration.

3.6 The user may at any time request termination of its registration in writing, provided that the deletion will not violate the proper performance of contractual relationships.
